Install
-------

The supported Python version for Hovercraft is Python 3.

Install Hovercraft inside a virtualenvwrapper::

  $ mkvirtualenv --no-site-packages presentations
  (presentations)$ pip install hovercraft
  
if using Python2.7, you'll also need to install configparser:: 
 
  (presentations)$ pip install configparser

Clone the Six Feet Up Landslide theme::

  $ cd presentations/
  $ git clone git@github.com:sixfeetup/sixfeetup_hovercraft.git

Create
------

Create a folder for your new presentation::

  $ mkdir sample
  $ cd sample
  $ touch slides.rst

Edit the new ReST file to build your presentation. See see https://hovercraft.readthedocs.org/en/1.0/_sources/examples/tutorial.txt for an example of a presentation written with ReST

Once you have written your slides, convert the file into the presentation::

  $ cd presentations/sample/
  $ workon presentations
  (presentations)$ hovercraft -t ../sixfeetup_hovercraft slides.rst .

You can now view the `index.html` that was created in a browser, or put your presentation's folder on the web. 


Create PDF
----------

The slideshow has been set up so that you can print to PDF from the browser. This currently works best from Firefox (it displays the footer on every page), but make sure to adjust the following settings in the Page Setup and Print menus:

 * Print in a landscape layout
 * Check ``Ignore Scaling and Shrink to Fit Page Width``
 * Check ``Print Background Colors``
 * Set all Page Headers and Page Footers to ``blank``

Custom Styles
-------------

Custom styles can be added to a single presentation by adding a CSS file.  The top of your .rst just needs to specify the path to the CSS files::

  :css: css/custom.css
 
Do not name a CSS file the same as one in the Six Feet Up theme, as it will be overwritten once the ``hovercraft`` command is run.

Pygments
--------

Various Pygments themes are available to use for the code blocks.  Currently, all will be copied over to your presentation folder when the ``hovercraft`` command is run. 

If a theme is not specified, the Solarized theme will be used.  To specify a theme, put this at the top of your .rst::

    :pygments: tango
    
Only that theme's CSS file will be loaded into the presentation. Check css/pygments to see the names of the themes available.
